## **PyZFS** code repository

**PyZFS** is a Python package for first-principles calculations of the zero-field-splitting (ZFS) tensor of molecules and materials based on wavefunctions obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. 

The tutorial and documentation are hosted on [Read the Docs](https://pyzfs-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
