Welcome to PyZFS's documentation!
=================================

**PyZFS** is an MPI-parallelized Python code for the first-principles calculation of the spin-spin zero-field-splitting (ZFS) tensor based on wavefunctions obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

**PyZFS** can work with wavefunctions generated by various plane-wave pseudopotential DFT codes including `Quantum Espresso <https://www.quantum-espresso.org/>`_ and `Qbox <http://qboxcode.org/>`_. **PyZFS** also supports the standard cube file format. **PyZFS** computes the spin-spin ZFS tensor from normalized pseudo-wavefunctions without projected-augmented-wave type corrections and is designed to be scalable to large calculations. For instance, **PyZFS** has been applied to study spin-defects in semiconductors using supercells containing thousands of valence electrons.

Starting from version 1.4, **PyZFS** can use NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate the calculation.
