Welcome to pyzfs's documentation!
=================================

**pyzfs** is an MPI-parallelized Python code for the first-principles calculation of the spin-spin zero-field-splitting (ZFS) tensor based on wavefunctions obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

**pyzfs** can work with wavefunctions generated by various plane-wave pseudopotential DFT codes including [**Quantum Espresso**](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) and [**Qbox**](http://qboxcode.org/). **pyzfs** also supports the standard cube file format. **pyzfs** computes the spin-spin ZFS tensor from normalized pseudo-wavefunctions without projected-augmented-wave type corrections and is designed to be scalable to large calculations. For instance, **pyzfs** has been applied to study spin-defects in semiconductors using supercells containing thousands of valence electrons.
